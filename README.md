# Project Title: Forecasting the Trend of Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu using Machine Learning

# Abstract:
The project aims to forecast the trend of Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu by leveraging machine learning techniques. It utilizes real-time data on daily Covid-19 cases, including active cases, confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases, incident rate, and fatality rate. The project involves preprocessing the data, applying time-series analysis, and utilizing the Prophet model for accurate predictions. The project's objective is to provide valuable insights for decision-making and help control the spread of the virus.

# Introduction:
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact globally, including in Tamil Nadu. Predicting the end of the pandemic and understanding its future trend is crucial. To address this, the project "Forecasting the Trend of Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu using Machine Learning" was developed. It analyzes real-time data, applies data science techniques, and visualizes the results to gain insights and communicate them effectively.

# Problem Statement:
The stakeholders, including government officials, healthcare professionals, and the general public, face challenges in formulating effective policies, allocating resources, and accessing accurate information on the prevalence and spread of Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu. The lack of a reliable forecasting model hinders decision-making processes and affects public health measures negatively.

# Project Objective:
The objectives of the project are as follows:
1. Collect and analyze daily Covid-19 data from Tamil Nadu to understand current trends.
2. Build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., FBProphet, Linear Regression, Time Series ARIMA, SVR) for accurate forecasting.
3. Select the best-performing model for predicting Covid-19 trends in Tamil Nadu.
4. Provide accurate and reliable predictions to assist decision-makers and the public in making informed decisions related to the pandemic.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to contribute to effective public health policies, resource allocation, and preventive measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in Tamil Nadu.
